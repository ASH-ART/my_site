# my_site
Very first site, trying my best to make it look cool

The idea here is to make a phtography portfolio website that I can use to advertise my work
In order to accomplish that, I need it to be well made enough not to scare any potential client
about my lack of attention to detail, but also to keep a cool and grey look that look like I know 
what I'm doing when it comes to web development. (spoiler : I don't)
So what I'm looking to accomplish is a showcase of my photo, as well as a way to contact me easily.
